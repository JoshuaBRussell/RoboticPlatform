## Operating Procedure for MS Study Data Collection

This has been updated to use 2 robotic platforms, and there are currently x
number of data collection procedure supported:
* Dual Platform CoP 
* Right Foot Standing Impedance (DP/IE directions)
* Left Foot Standing Impedance (DP/IE directions)
* Right Foot Walking Impedance (DP Only)

Currently, the Simulink models use the variables located in the MATLAB base 
workspace to populate the variables used in the Simulink model. 


## Data Collection Procedure Instructions:
### Dual Platform CoP

### Right Foot Standing Impedance (DP/IE directions)

### Left Foot Standing Impedance (DP/IE directions)

### Right Foot Walking Impedance (DP Only)
